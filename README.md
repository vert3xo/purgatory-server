# Purgatory BungeeCord plugin
This is a BungeeCord plugin with custom made ban system that will connect banned player to special server.

# Config
In `config.yml` you can customize messages and name of special server for banned players. All messages can be colored with [these color codes](https://www.spigotmc.org/attachments/example2-png.188806/).
`bans.yml` file is for storing banned player's UUIDs, display names and reasons for bans. This file should **not** be edited.

# WIP
~~Permissions not yet implemented. Until I add them you won't be able to stop players from banning whoever they want!~~ Permissions are now working

Unban system not yet implemented. If you want to unban a player you will have to manually remove their entry from `bans.yml` file.
